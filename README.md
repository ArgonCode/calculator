### Used tech and libraries
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript. Vanilla, no frameworks.

## Takes into account:
1. Floating points are ignored after one is already present.
2. Pressing operator more than once:
  * if the operator is the same, nothing happens,
  * if the operator is different than before, it gets updated.
3. When the operation is calculated, it is displayed, and the number can be treated as if it was entered manually.
4. It can be operated by clicking on the calculator or using keyboard keys.

## Does not take into account:
1. Order of operation is not taken into account. E.g.: inputing `3 + 2 * 2` will result in `10` not in `12`.
